# Steps
image enhabce from preprocess.py
# 1. image enhance
# 2. invert image
# 3. edge compute using autocanny
# 4. image masking i.e ultra high contrast
# 5. remove inner circles using cv2.circles and masked image

Draw mires from utils.py
1. 
2. 


Find mires from mire_detection.py
Uses angle filling method
1. Median filtering
2. Get tuple of ? values for curves segments
3. Fill curves
4. clean_points will get locations of mires?
5. Generate new image with filled mires?
6. def cleanup_plots_heuristics: Trying to ensure that the plots.png has smooth values: 
    # (a) no value of zero, 
    # (b) no higher mire touching a lower mire, 
    # (c) no random peaks in one mire
7. 




# Threshold image
# autocanny
# iris segmenter from preprocess.py
